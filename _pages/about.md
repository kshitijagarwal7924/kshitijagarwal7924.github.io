I am a postdoctoral researcher at **Università degli Studi di Trieste** and **INFN – Sezione di Trieste**, working on silicon detector instrumentation for high-energy and nuclear physics experiments.

My research focuses on the design, thermal management, and mechanical integration of **large-area, low-mass silicon tracking detectors**, with particular emphasis on **radiation-hard MAPS technologies**, lightweight support structures, and advanced cooling concepts. I am currently involved in R&D for next-generation tracking systems for **ALICE 3** and **ePIC**, addressing coupled mechanical, thermal, and electrical constraints in high-rate, high-radiation environments.

During my PhD at **Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen**, based in part at **GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research**, I led the development of a quantitative framework for defining safe operating conditions for irradiated silicon sensors in the **CBM Silicon Tracking System (STS)**. This work resulted in the conception and experimental validation of a **liquid-assisted air-cooling** approach, significantly reducing material budget while maintaining thermal stability.

In parallel, I contribute to physics studies of **dense nuclear matter**, combining heavy-ion collision data with astrophysical observations to constrain the nuclear equation of state. I am actively engaged in scientific communication through conference presentations, invited talks, and interdisciplinary outreach.

I am interested in detector R&D, cross-experiment synergies, and collaborations at the interface of instrumentation and physics.
